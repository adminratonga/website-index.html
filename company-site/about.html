	  <h2>Company Overview: Ratonga Property Services</h2>
	  <p><strong>Reliable. Professional. Proven.</strong></p>

	  <p>
	    At <strong>Ratonga Property Services</strong>, we are more than builders and tradespeople—we are partners in creating safe, comfortable, and functional spaces where people live, work, and thrive. Since our inception, we have operated with a people-first philosophy, understanding that architecture is not just about structures, but about improving lives through thoughtful environments.
	  </p>

	  <p>
	    Founded with little more than a clear vision and a deep commitment to quality, Ratonga began as a small home renovation and maintenance business. Through steady growth, skilled craftsmanship, and the trust of our clients, we have evolved into a <strong>full-service construction and property services company</strong>, proudly serving the <strong>Wellington and Manawatū-Whanganui regions</strong>.
	  </p>

	  <h3>Our Commitment</h3>
	  <p>We are dedicated to delivering high-quality solutions across a broad range of service areas. Our promise to our clients is simple:</p>
	  <ul>
	    <li>We restore vacant homes and bring them back to life</li>
	    <li>We decontaminate and rehabilitate damaged or unsafe properties</li>
	    <li>We maintain, clean, and paint with attention to every detail</li>
	    <li>We build fences, lay flooring, repair roofing, and upgrade electrical and plumbing systems</li>
	    <li>We deliver results—on time, on budget, and with pride</li>
	  </ul>

	  <p>
	    To date, we have successfully completed <strong>over 350 projects across the North Island</strong>, including meth decontamination for more than 40 properties and extensive renovation work for Housing NZ and private clients.
	  </p>

	  <h3>Our Team</h3>
	  <p>
	    Our strength lies in our people. With a team of <strong>over 20 experienced professionals</strong>, including <strong>electricians, plumbers, roofers, and carpenters</strong>, we offer seamless coordination across all project stages.

	  </p>

	  <p>
	    Whether it’s a single-room repair or a multi-dwelling development, every project is approached with the same level of care, precision, and respect for the client’s vision and values.
	  </p>

	  <h3>Resilience &amp; Reliability</h3>
